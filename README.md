## Goals 
The goal of this assignment was to create a team profile generator that would meet the below criteria:

+ When a user is prompted to select an employee, they are able to input information unique to each employee
+ All of the user's inputs will populate to a newly generated HTML page based on the corresponding employee's information
+ The generated HTML page will be nicely formatted and contain links to an engineer's GitHub profile, in addition to the default email program opening when a user clicks a team member's email address

## Results 
This project turned out well, but one thing I struggled with was the linkage between the files and getting the HTML page to generate. After a few debugging sessions with my classmates and a tutor, I was able to correct the linkages and get the HTML file to generate. Once the HTML file was generating, all I had to do was clean up a few of the variable names and remove a bracket or two from my HTML code in the template.js file.
